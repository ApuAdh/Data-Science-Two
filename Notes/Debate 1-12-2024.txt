Debate topics:

1) Data Science is/isn't a synonum for Artificial Intelligence
2) Machine learning is/isn't a synonym for Artificial Intelligence
3) Machine Learning is/isn't a synonym for Data Science

Artificial Intelligence Definition: Computer Systems that are able to perform tasks that are historically hard for computers and easier for hummans

My Shit: 
    Topic I am arguing for: Machine Learning is a synonym for Data Science
    
    My Arguments:

        -While both fields encompass a wide range of activities
        -Machine Learning stands out as a crucial subset
            -Significantly contributes to the broader landscape of Data Science
        -The core essence of extracting insights from data is common to both
        -Machine Learning plays a pivotal role in achieving this goal

        -Machine Learning is a subset of Data Science
            -Driving force behind predictive analytics and automated decision-making
        -Ability of machines to learn from data without explicit programming
            -Defining characteristic of both Machine Learning and Data Science
        -Utilization of advanced algorithms and models in Machine Learning
            -Integral part of the data science workflow
            -Enhances predictive capabilities essential for informed decision-making
    
        -In summary, Machine Learning is not just a component of Data Science but a synonym
            -Represents advanced techniques within the broader field
            -Enables turning raw data into actionable insights

    Possible Counter Arguments:

        -Data Science is a comprehensive field
            -Encompasses a spectrum of activities
                -Data collection
                -Cleaning
                -Analysis
                -Interpretation
        -Machine Learning is a specialized subset
            -Focuses on the development of algorithms and models

        -Data Science involves various techniques beyond Machine Learning
            -Statistical analysis
            -Data visualization
            -Exploratory data analysis
        -These techniques are fundamental to the holistic approach of Data Science
        -Considering Machine Learning as synonymous undermines the diversity and richness that Data Science offers

        -The scope of Data Science extends beyond predictive analytics and automated decision-making
            -Includes understanding patterns
            -Generating actionable insights
            -Communicating findings effectively
        -Machine Learning, while powerful, is just one tool in the Data Scientist's toolbox

        -In conclusion, while Machine Learning is a valuable component
            -Falls short of being a synonym for Data Science
            -Data Science encompasses a broader set of skills, methods, and objectives

    Rebuttal:

        -The strength of the synonymy argument lies in recognizing the significant role that Machine Learning plays within the realm of
         Data Science
            -Not about diminishing the importance of other data science techniques
            -Acknowledging that Machine Learning stands as a key pillar
            -Key in achieving the ultimate goal of deriving meaningful insights from data

Our Script:

        We acknowledge machine learning isn't an exact same thing as data science, according to IBM the definition of Machine Learning is a
    branch of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that
    humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy, whereas the definition of Data Science is using the combination of maths, 
    statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics and AI/Machine Learning in order to uncover actionable insights that can 
    be used to make decisions that benefit someone or something in the future. If we look at high level algorithms around us like 
    youtube recommendations that use a very high level of data science, we can see that Machine Learning is a very big part of it,
    such a big part infact that if you get rid of it, it would be completely dismanteled. It's like a stool and it's legs where,
    yes the legs are not the stool but if you get rid of the legs and then try to use the stool again you are just sitting on the
    floor at that point.

        According to the merriam webster, one of the definitionss of "synonym" is " a word or phrase that by association is held to 
    embody something". We are currently at a point where every large and meaningful data science systems use machine learning to such 
    a high degree that, Yes machine learing is infact a synonym for data science
